# Predicting the Success or Failure of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Abstract
Fueled by media coverage of massive success stories, Kickstarter has become a popular crowdfunding platform where creators can seek funds to turn their ideas into products. However, only a third of projects manage to reach their fundraising goals and little is known about the ingredients required to make a successful Kickstarer campaign. To solve this problem, we analyzed over 380,000 Kickstarter campaigns from 2009 to 2018 and ran a plethora of machine learning algorithms to predict whether a campaign will be a success or not. In general, accuracy was low across all models due to underfitting. Tree-based models performed better with XGBoost as the winner with an accuracy of 70.23% and recall of 43.64%. Our results indicate a need for more features by way of feature engineering or scraping more data to improve the performance of our models.
